		<Text>ZAMIO: Fascinating, we have thought this system uninhabitated, that we were the first to come here but this just proves one came before us</Text>

		<Text>NANOUK: Yes indeed, while this system is in its infancy, it clearly piqued the interest of another traveller, many years before</Text>

		<Text>NANOUK: SIGH. It is times like this that I dearly miss our access to the Central Information Repository</Text>

		<Text>NANOUK: Still, I'm not sure how much help it would be in this situation. Coleus took a look and said it is no language he ever saw</Text>

		<ParentID>6</ParentID>
		<Text>NANOUK: Yes you are quite right! The waveform is rather spectacular, unlike any we have seen before. I plan to search for a signal of its frequency, there is nothing in this system, but perhaps further afield?</Text>
