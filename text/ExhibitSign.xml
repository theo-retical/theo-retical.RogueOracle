			<Page>According to the translation device created here at the observatory, this relic, originally brought to us by Chert on their travels, was discovered by the Nomai of Timber Hearth</Page>
			<Page>They sent it to Ember Twin for further study where Chert found it buried beneath the sand in a small Nomai cave.</Page>
			<Page>The device appears to predate the Nomai, and indeed they were as curious about its origins as we are</Page>
